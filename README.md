# Sudoku-Solver-with-GA
This project implements a Sudoku Solver using a Genetic Algorithm. The Genetic Algorithm is a search and optimization technique inspired by the process of natural selection. It aims to find the best solution (a solved Sudoku grid) by iteratively generating and improving a population of candidate solutions.
